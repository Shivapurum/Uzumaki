    <h1>DevOps Methodologies</h1>
   
    <h2>1. Continuous Integration (CI)</h2>
    <p>Continuous Integration involves automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository several times a day. This practice aims to detect integration bugs early, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to release new software updates.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD, Bamboo</li>
        <li><strong>Practices:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Automated testing (unit tests, integration tests)</li>
                <li>Automated builds</li>
                <li>Frequent commits to version control</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>2. Continuous Delivery (CD)</h2>
    <p>Continuous Delivery ensures that code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production. With CD, software can be released to production at any time, often using automated pipelines to deploy code changes to staging and production environments.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Spinnaker, AWS CodePipeline, Azure DevOps</li>
        <li><strong>Practices:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Automated deployment pipelines</li>
                <li>Staging environments that mirror production</li>
                <li>Automated acceptance tests</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>3. Continuous Deployment</h2>
    <p>Continuous Deployment takes Continuous Delivery a step further by automatically deploying every change that passes the automated tests to production, without manual intervention.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Same as Continuous Delivery tools</li>
        <li><strong>Practices:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Automated production deployments</li>
                <li>Monitoring and logging for production environments</li>
                <li>Rollback mechanisms in place</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h2>
    <p>Infrastructure as Code involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Ansible, Puppet, Chef</li>
        <li><strong>Practices:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Version control for infrastructure definitions</li>
                <li>Automated provisioning and configuration</li>
                <li>Reproducible infrastructure environments</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>5. Monitoring and Logging</h2>
    <p>Monitoring and logging are crucial for understanding application performance, detecting issues, and ensuring reliability. These practices involve collecting, analyzing, and responding to performance data and logs from applications and infrastructure.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, Datadog, New Relic</li>
        <li><strong>Practices:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Centralized logging</li>
                <li>Real-time monitoring and alerting</li>
                <li>Performance metrics and analysis</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>6. Configuration Management</h2>
    <p>Configuration Management involves maintaining systems, software, and infrastructure in a desired, consistent state. This practice helps in managing changes and configurations across multiple environments.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Ansible, Puppet, Chef, SaltStack</li>
        <li><strong>Practices:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Automated configuration scripts</li>
                <li>Version control for configuration files</li>
                <li>Idempotent operations to ensure consistent state</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>7. Collaboration and Communication</h2>
    <p>Effective collaboration and communication are at the heart of DevOps, breaking down silos between development, operations, and other stakeholders.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Slack, Microsoft Teams, Jira, Confluence, Trello</li>
        <li><strong>Practices:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Regular stand-up meetings and retrospectives</li>
                <li>Cross-functional teams</li>
                <li>Shared goals and metrics</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>8. Automated Testing</h2>
    <p>Automated testing ensures that new code changes do not break existing functionality and meet the required quality standards before they are integrated and deployed.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Selenium, JUnit, NUnit, TestNG, Mocha, Jest</li>
        <li><strong>Practices:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Unit testing, integration testing, system testing</li>
                <li>Test-driven development (TDD)</li>
                <li>Behavior-driven development (BDD)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>9. Security (DevSecOps)</h2>
    <p>Integrating security practices into the DevOps pipeline (often referred to as DevSecOps) ensures that security is considered at every stage of the development and deployment process.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, Aqua Security, HashiCorp Vault</li>
        <li><strong>Practices:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Automated security testing</li>
                <li>Vulnerability scanning</li>
                <li>Secure coding practices</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>10. Version Control Systems (VCS)</h2>
    <p>Version control systems are essential for tracking changes to code, configurations, and documents, enabling collaboration and maintaining history.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Git, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial</li>
        <li><strong>Practices:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Branching and merging strategies (e.g., GitFlow, trunk-based development)</li>
                <li>Commit messages and documentation</li>
                <li>Code reviews and pull requests</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
